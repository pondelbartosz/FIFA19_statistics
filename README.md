# FIFA19_statistics

## Description
The goal of the project was to analyze players statistics from the video game FIFA19. To achieve this, the following visualizations were created:
1. A ranking of the most valuable player (with the ability to filter players by position and select the parameter: wage/value/release clause).
2. World maps showing the number of players in the game and the most expensive player from each country.
3. A chart displaying the value of players at a given age (with the option to select statistic: max/min/median/average) and a chart showing the overall rating of players at a given age.
4. A table showing the release clause in each club and a bubble chart containing information about the player's earnings and their rating in the game.

These visualizations were compiled into a Story that met the project objectives.
